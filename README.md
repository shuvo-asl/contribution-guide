# Contribution guideline into ASL Tech & Devs Team
This is the guideline to contribute **ASL Tech & Devs Team**. Basically we are using **GIT & Github** for version control system. If you want to contribute our projects then you have to know about **GIT** and familiar with **Github**. When you want to contribute the projects then you have to maintain the following rules:

- You have to update your `ASANA` board from `pending/new requests` to `progress`.
- Create new branch for your assigned task by the following rules:
    - feature/`{DATE}`-`SHORT TITLE OF THE TASK WITHOUT SPACE`.
    - The short title space will be replace by `-`.
    - `DATE` should be like `{YEAR_MONTH_DAY}`.
    - NO `_` will not allow in `DATE`. Example `20240331`.
- When you push your commit into the `GIT` on that time you have to maintain commitlint rules.
- Once you complete your task then create a PR from `feature branch` to `stage branch`.
    - In PR details you have to mention all of the change log
- Update your  `ASANA` board from `progress` to `done`. Also you have to update add the PR link as comment in your task.
