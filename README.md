# Contribution guidelines for the SL Tech & Devs Team
This is the guideline to contribute **ASL Tech & Devs Team**. Basically, we are using **GIT & Github** for a version control system. If you want to contribute to our projects, then you have to know about **GIT** and be familiar with **GitHub**. When you want to contribute to the projects, you have to maintain the following rules:

- You need to update your `Asana` board from `Not Started/New Requests` to `In Progress`.
- Create a new branch for your assigned task by the following rules:
    - feature/`[{TASK_ID}] OR {DATE}`-` SHORT TITLE OF THE TASK WITHOUT SPACE`.
    - The short title space will be replaced by `-`.
    - `DATE` should be like `{YEAR_MONTH_DAY}`.
    - NO `_` will not allow in `DATE`. Example `20240331`.
- When you push your commit into the `GIT` at that time, you have to maintain the commitlint rules.
- After finishing the task, you have to open a Pull Request from the created branch to the parent branch.
- Pull request title should start with `[TASK_ID] .........`
Once you have completed your task, update the PR description.
    - In PR details, you have to mention the entire change log.
    - Set the reviewers.
    - Set the `PR` label & Assign.
    - Add this code at the bottom of the task: `{MAGIC_WORDS} [TASK_ID]`
- Update your  `ASANA` board from `progress` to `done`. Also, you have to update and  add the PR link as a comment in your task.
